## A simple Bank Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.
The project demonstrates Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction — implemented with separate class files for modular design.

### CONCEPT USED
OOP Concept used

* Encapsulation : bundling data into single unit

* Inheritance:child class allow to uses parentclass

* Polymorphism : object to take multiple form depending upon the context used

* Abstraction :showing necessary information hiding internal information
